## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think the challenge was working with background images and applying color to them. Then, several adjustments changed the arrangement of elements at different browser breakpoints.

```css
background: linear-gradient(
    0deg,
    rgba(var(--color-cyan-600-rgb), 0.9),
    rgba(var(--color-cyan-600-rgb), 0.9)
  ), url(./assets/mobile/image-footer.jpg) no-repeat;
background-size: 100% 100%;
```
